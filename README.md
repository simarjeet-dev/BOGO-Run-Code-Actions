# BOGO-Run-Code-Actions

This repository contains a codebase designed to automate and manage BOGO (Buy One, Get One) sale actions for e-commerce platforms or retail environments. It allows for dynamic application of BOGO promotions on selected products, ensuring accurate calculations and consistent application of promotional rules across the system.

## Available files
Each example contains the following files:

- `input.graphql` - the GraphQL query that is used to fetch the data that is passed to the action.
- `output.graphql` - the GraphQL schema that tells Flow what data to expect from your code's return.
- `index.js` - the JavaScript code that is run by the action.

The example folder will also contain a tests folder that contains one or more tests for the example (see below).
